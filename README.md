## What are we going to cover in this analysis?

The first step is to clean the data. This includes removing any duplicate or incomplete records. We will also convert any categorical data to numerical data.

Once the data has been cleaned, we will perform some basic statistical analysis. This will help us to understand the distribution of the data and identify any trends.

Finally, we will use the results of the statistical analysis to identify the most promising customer segments. We will then develop a marketing strategy that is targeted at these segments.

We believe that this approach will help Sprocket to identify the right customers to target and boost their revenue.
